## About

`cdp-design` is used to maintain all the styling and graphic design assets required for the various websites in the CDP ecosystem.

This means that any design changes made here propagate to:

- [councildataproject.org](https://councildataproject.org/): The primary website for the entire organization
- [cdp-frontend](https://github.com/CouncilDataProject/cdp-frontend): A library that is used by all CDP instance websites

## Developer Usage

### CDP Images

Images are injected as a [CSS content attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/content).

Logo image classes follow the specification: `cdp-logo-{primaryColor}-bg-{backgroundColor}`

Icon image classes follow the specification: `cdp-icon-{primaryColor}-bg-{backgroundColor}-size-{int}`

Example:

```javascript
import "@councildataproject/cdp-design/dist/images.css";

// assume you have a component
// sets the content of this div to the CDP logo
<div className="cdp-logo-black-bg-transparent">...</div>;
// OR an icon
<div className="cdp-icon-black-bg-transparent-size-64">...</div>;
```

### CDP Colors

Colors are simple color or background-color CSS attributes.

Content colors follow the specification: `cdp-{color}`

Background colors folow the specification: `cdp-bg-{color}`

Example:

```javascript
import "@councildataproject/cdp-design/dist/colors.css";

// assume you have a component
// sets the background color of this div to dark purple
// sets the text color to white
<div className="cdp-bg-dark-purple cdp-white">Hello World!</div>;
```

### Favicon

The most update-to-date favicon will always be found at:
[`src/static/images/favicon.ico`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CouncilDataProject/cdp-design/main/src/static/images/favicon.ico)

## Contributing

Much of this library and design system are auto-generated from a few key assets:

- `src/static/css/cdp-text.css`: All typography styling.
- `src/static/images/icon/black-bg-transparent.png`: The CDP icon, used for favicons, headers, etc. with all content of the icon in black and a transparent background.
- `src/static/images/icon/white-bg-transparent.png`: The CDP icon, used for favicons, headers, etc. with all content of the icon in white and a transparent background.
- `src/static/images/logo/black-bg-transparent.png`: The full CDP logo, used for branding with all content of the logo in black and a transparent background.
- `src/static/images/logo/white-bg-transparent.png`: The full CDP logo, used for branding with all content of the logo in white and a transparent background.
- `generate-cdp-colors.js`: The script to generate the `cdp-colors.css` file.

For example, if you wanted to propose a change to our logo you would:

1. Fork the `cdp-design` repository.
2. Clone your "forked" `cdp-design` repository to your local machine.
3. Replace the `black-bg-transparent.png` and the `white-bg-transparent.png` files located in the `src/static/images/logo/` directory.
4. Run `npm run generate` from the command line to generate all the new image variants.
5. Verify that all assets have been created properly in a file browser by viewing the `src/static/images/logo` directory.
6. Add, commit, and push the new logo files to your fork.
7. Create a pull request from your fork to this repository.

### Design Guidelines
